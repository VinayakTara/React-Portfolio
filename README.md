Common Errors and Their Solutions
1. Error: "Module not found"
Solution: This happens when a module or file is not properly imported or does not exist. Double-check the import statements and the file paths.

Example:
javascript
Copy code
import PageHeaderContent from './components/pageHeaderContent'; // Ensure the file path is correct
2. Error: "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object."
Solution: This occurs when the component is imported incorrectly. For instance, if you accidentally import a named export as a default one, you might face this issue.

Check how you are importing the component. If you're using a named export, make sure you're importing it correctly:

javascript
Copy code
import { PageHeaderContent } from './components/pageHeaderContent'; // If it's a named export
If it's a default export, import it as follows:

javascript
Copy code
import PageHeaderContent from './components/pageHeaderContent'; // For default export
3. Error: "npm command not found"
Solution: This usually happens when npm is not installed or is not recognized in your terminal. Make sure Node.js and npm are installed correctly.

Check if npm is installed by running:
bash
Copy code
npm -v
If not installed, reinstall Node.js from here.
4. Error: "Unable to resolve 'react-simple-animate'"
Solution: This error can occur if you forget to install the required dependencies. Run:

bash
Copy code
npm install react-simple-animate
5. Error: "Error: Cannot find module 'tsparticles'"
Solution: You might be missing the tsparticles library. Run the following command to install it:

bash
Copy code
npm install tsparticles
